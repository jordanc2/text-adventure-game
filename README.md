# Text Adventure Project

Welcome to the Text Adventure Project! This is intended to showcase a good handle on the Java fundamentals that became my core foundation and my first journey into object oriented programming. 

You can find instructions for each assignment by going to the `Instructions` folder within this project. I found it most helpful to create and run tests and the lint checker regularly to make sure I was on track.
